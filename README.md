# PokePanion

PokePanion is your companion for Pokemon adventures :) It uses Optical Character Recognition to extract information about the battlefield and provide you with information about your opponent.

## Notes

-   `UraniumCompanion` uses "magic numbers" that work on my displays. I don't plan to adapt them to other display resolutions if they do not work.
